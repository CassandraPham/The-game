# Mancala game

This project demonstrates my competence in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns through the development of a Mancala game in Java. As the project evolved, I progressively integrated additional features to enhance user experience. These additions enable users to initiate, save, and load games, expanding beyond the core functionalities of a Mancala game.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on ensuring the code's comprehensibility, readability, and modifiability, thereby prioritising its long-term maintainability.
